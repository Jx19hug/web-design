        A cold case!</h2>

            A gentle snowfall blanketed the archaeology dig site, turning the rows of tents and tools into a peaceful winter scene. <br>
            Lanterns glowed warmly against the drifting flakes, and strings of simple Christmas lights flickered between the equipment stands, giving the whole area a festive shimmer. <br>
            Despite the cold, researchers worked carefully at the edge of a newly uncovered structure, their breath forming small clouds as they brushed away snow to reveal hints of the past. <br>
            The mix of holiday cheer and ancient mystery made the snowy site feel almost magical—like history itself was offering a seasonal surprise.<br>
